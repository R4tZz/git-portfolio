## üëã About Me

Since childhood, I've been driven by curiosity about how things work - dismantling toys and reassembling them to see if they still functioned. This natural inclination led me to the IT world, where I discovered my passion for creating tools that automate routine tasks and improve processes.

Over the past 6+ years, I've specialized as a **QA and Test Automation Engineer**, focusing on automation frameworks, data engineering, and telecommunications systems. I have a proven track record of designing scalable test automation solutions and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines.
